# speedreading

A crude html page coded in one day with some JS for speedreading.
But hey, at least it's self-contained.

Live version here: https://adrienmatricon.github.io/speedreading/speedreading.html

### How it works
* Copy/paste a text you want to speedread.
* Click "Start".
* That's it! Just keep your eyes on the highlighted bold text to speedread.


* Use the buttons to pause or resume your reading, or to fully stop and copy/paste a new text.
* Click on a word if you want to jump to it.
* Adjust the speed (in word per minute) to your liking, as well as the number of selected words.
