# speedreading

A crude html page coded in one day with some JS for speedreading.
But hey, at least it's self-contained.

### How it works
* Copy/paste a text you want to speedread.
* Click "Start".
* That's it! Just keep your eyes on the bold text to speedread.


* Use the buttons to pause or resume your reading, or to fully stop and copy/paste a new text.
* Adjust the speed (in word per minute) to your liking.

### Version history

- **v1.0:** basic version
- **v1.1:** button to save preferences, several words in bold at once
